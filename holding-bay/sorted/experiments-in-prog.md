# Experiments in Progress

Enduring experiments and proof-of-concepts that aren't going to be overnight projects. These are ongoing explorations to see if particular approaches or ideas work in practice.

## LLM Detective

This one could be added to a category of intriguing AI experiments intended to probe the potential, strange effects of simulated intelligence when they meet us.

## LLM Max Token Length 0225

This would actually be worth running again, as it's one of the parameters in AI models that continues to get extremely little attention but which I think is extremely important in practice.

## Side Hustle Ideation Agent

A fun idea with practical utility, especially exploring the interesting concept of using an agent to do ideation batches. The main challenge in attempts at this is avoiding repetition, which is hard to figure out given constraints around memory and context. You can't provide the entire generated list as context for every turn, but it was both fun and interesting to try it out.
